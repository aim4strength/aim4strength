&ldquo;Approximately 1 year ago I walked into a fitness class be taught by Julie
Smith at Aim4Strength Fitness. I was at least 100 pounds overweight and
after many years of pre-diabetes had just been diagnosed as diabetic. I
went into class and within 15 minutes was ready to throw up and quit. I
was angry with myself and humiliated that I couldn’t even do a 30 minute
workout. During that workout Julie consistently showed different
modifications to the exercises for all skill levels without individually
pointing anybody out. After the workout she approached me as I was
trying to crawl away. She talked to me about my expectations and let me
know that coming was the first step. She was so encouraging and
welcoming that I decide to keep trying.

&ldquo;Fast forward 1 year. I am down 65 pounds. I am stronger and healthier I
venture to say than I have ever been in my life and I 100% thank Julie for
that. Through her constant encouragement I have not only upped my
weekly exercise, but I have changed my whole lifestyle. Julie meets you
at whatever level you are at. She is the first trainer that did not
browbeat me or make me feel awful about who I was and how out of
shape I was. That is not to say that she will go easy on you. She calls it
like she sees it and is honest with you about what you need to do to
achieve your fitness goals. She takes that time to learn who you are as a
person and what your goals and roadblocks are and then creates a path
for you to achieve. Her workouts are hard but fun and as you progress
on your path to fitness she creates more challenging workouts to
continuously push you all the while celebrating your accomplishments.
She has taken numerous calls and texts as I try to navigate my new eating styles. Education is her goal. She doesn’t necessarily want you to follow
a specific diet plan, she wants you to begin a lifestyle change that is
sustainable and healthy for you, and that is different for each client she
sees. I have met many of Julie’s other clients and I know they receive
the same personal attention that I do.

&ldquo;Julie not only is a fitness and lifestyle coach but she has been there. She
has the unique perspective of knowing what it is like to have 100+ extra
pounds crunching on your knees and ankles as you are trying to take it
off. She knows the despair of thinking it is too late and feeling like you
are to far gone to ever go back. She understands what it is like to feel
like no “diet” if ever going to work because you can’t stick to it. I have
felt along the way that every pound I have lost and every push-up I can
now do it not only my celebration but hers as well.

&ldquo;Julie has created Aim4strength Fitness with a vision. I feel like the other
trainers she hires must all share that understanding that it is about the
client. It is about making them feel valued and walking the journey with
them. Her unique business of going in to homes for personal training, or
going to business offices to help out groups or individuals with limited
time frames, and last but not least having group classes for anyone who
wants to be part of group offers so many different options for every
individual. Do yourself the ultimate favor and check out Julie Smith with
Aim4Strength Fitness.&rdquo; &ndash; E.M.
