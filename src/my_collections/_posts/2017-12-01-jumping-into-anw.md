‘Merica….Ninja Warrior, That Is.

Yes, its that time of year where American Ninja Warrior starts to search for the most talented people out there to go to Mt Midoriyama.  Well, search no further.  I am here, friends.

I love the thought of going through a whole course and being such a total boss that when Kristine Leahy asks me how I did it, I am going to say, “it was really no biggie, Kristine.”

If age and gas were the defining factor, I would win hands down, no question about it. Just because I am pushing 50 and have been morbidly obese for 75% of my life doesn’t mean I can’t do tryouts. I mean, man, I got a shelf life here. I could need CPR and a whole lot of shocks if I wait much longer.

Now that I have decided to apply, I am kind of freaking out.  Like ‘going into the bathroom and hyperventilating for a few minutes before trying to look all put together’ freaking out.…  How the heck am I even going to accomplish this?  What kinds of workouts will I be doing?




  * The first order of business is to wrap my head around what I will be asked to do.  Sounds dumb, right?  I mean, duh, you have seen ANW, so you know what is expected of you…..wrong. The jumping spider looks easy, but to do it? Fear of falling freaks me out, and I know that its more in my head than it is I can’t do something.


  * My workouts will consist of pull-ups. Followed by pull-ups.  Spattered with a little jumping pull-ups for a finisher.  What I am trying to say is that I will be doing a ton of pull-ups.  Most of the show the contestants are hanging on to small ledges, doorknobs and ropes.  I will need superb grip strength, insane upper body strength and high intensity training for sure….Oh crap, I am in trouble….


  * Keep it fun.  I will have to remind myself of this daily. I like to win.  I like to hang upside down.  I like challenging myself.  Usually, fun is not on the top of my list, because I let all the other things cloud this fundamental rule.  I am the kind of person if you tell me I can’t, I will find a way, especially if its important to me.


  * Take from different types of sports/genres of fitness.  Rock climbing, Gymnastics, Parkour, Calisthenics—they all have something that can be used on the ANW course.  The common theme is upper body strength and high intensity training.


  * Train smarter not harder.  Short bouts of HIIT with monkey bar work, dead hangs, pull ups, balance work and ab work with strength training sprinkled in.  I will be doing 3 upper body days and 2 lower body days.  I will have some HIIT every day that I work out, and it will be used as a superset to every exercise.  This is so that I can get my heart up to snuff and because I am slow at everything I do.  I am going to try to tolerate this workout regime and want to be in the gym no longer than 1.5 hours a day.


  * Diet.  Oh. My. Gosh. This will be hands down the hardest.  I have a coach for bodybuilding and am eating to those goals…..well, I am trying, anyways.  I will have to lose weight so those will possibly need to be changed.  Right now I eat a good deal of protein, and will still keep doing that.  I also eat a good deal of carbs, which I will need for high intensity training.  I guess I will need to reign it in so that I can do my best.


So thats it.  I would love for you to tell me what YOU think I should do that would make me more prepared for this.  I have done a lot of reading on the subject, but there is so much out there, I just feel overwhelmed.  I picked the very things that I feel like you need on the course.  Some things are just plain scary, jumping being one of them.  I am old, hence the fear of falling and breaking a hip is a totally real fear.  Also, I am trying out an ANW gym in Los Angeles.  I have a call in to them to see if they would be willing to host me and a few friends to try and get acquainted with some basic ANW things on the course—the warped wall being one of them as well as the salmon ladder. I will be doing weekly updates on training and what is working versus what is not working-wish me luck!!
