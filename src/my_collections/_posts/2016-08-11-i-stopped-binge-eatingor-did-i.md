You probably think that since I have lost 160+ pounds that I have the food thing figured out, right? I mean, how can you lose that much weight without exercising your face off and eating all organic, whole foods you can get from your own back yard? In fact, when I go places with friends, they offer me cupcakes (OMG I absolutely LOVE cake) and say “well, since your thin now, you can eat that” or my personal favorite, “don’t be so militant, you only live once!”. WRONG!




Now, I am not saying I don't eat those things every now and then, but it’s pretty rare. I am 6 years out from losing this weight, and I am still a zealot when it comes to tracking my food and logging everything that passes by my lips. Hell, I have nightmares when I think I forgot something in my logging app—yes, obsessive behavior at its finest! Most will scoff and think who wants to be on a diet for the rest of their life or that I don't have a balanced life. Guess what? I don’t! I have big food issues—you don't balloon to 300 pounds for no good reason.




My vice is binge eating. I would love to say binge eating is awful, terrible and that I hate it. Truth be told, I feel absolutely amazing and satisfied when doing it. Afterwards, I feel guilt and shame, but honestly I feel like a million bucks physically. I know I am supposed to feel crappy after eating a whole cake or pizza, but physically I don’t. My body loves chocolate layer cake and feels the happiest when a whole cake is in my belly. Mentally, though, it is a horrible cycle of guilt and shame, then anger at yourself for doing the same thing you promised yourself you wouldn't do time and time again. Do not misconstrue what I am saying: it is not ok to binge eat. It comes with a whole host of mental mind games like guilt, shame, anger and inequity. Most of us binge to forget any problems or feelings that we don't want to face. This is no bueno. But let’s call a spade a spade—people wouldn't do it if it didn't feel good, and lots of people do it, otherwise we wouldn't have a whole country full of fat people.




Is there hope? Of course there is. I have to say, just because I lost the weight doesn't mean I don't still have food issues. Food is my drug and that will never go away. And like a drug addict, I have to face this daily, acknowledging that I have the power to change it and forgive myself when I fall off the wagon. Oh and believe me, I have fallen off the wagon too many times to count. We are not perfect beings and your habits and chemical makeup are still going to be ingrained in you even if it’s to a lesser degree. Cake is still delicious, and I can still eat like a truck driver on steroids. I know I have a huge problem when I go to the cheesecake factory with friends and finish all of their food that they are too full to eat. (food rookies…!) Unlike my friends, I don't have a stop button. I am like a goat who would eat the shirt off its owner if he could get a hold of it.




So, how do you stop binging? Before losing the weight, every diet plan or every exercise plan I approached with a type A attitude. I was either going to do it, or I wasn’t. If I fell off the wagon, I said screw it, I am going to eat since I already messed up. I had pretty much given diets up by the age of 41, and just accepted the fact that I was going to be a fat with lots of health issues for the rest of my life. However, the weight loss contest we did at work saved me. I was focused on something other than weight. I knew how to get from point A to point B if it wasn't weight loss related. I wanted to win money. Plain and simple. End goal—WIN. I figured after the contest I would gain it all back anyways, so I went into it with that mindset. I ate “around” my food issues. I knew I would binge—duh, no secret since that is what I have always done. So, I implemented my 49/51% rule. I had to eat healthy 51% of the time. Over 50% made me a success, so I knew I would be successful if I hit 51%. I built in binging into my diet—I know, another “no no” in the health and fitness world. Once I knew that I could be 51% successful, the pressure to be perfect dissipated and I actually binged less.  Today, I would have to say I am about 70% successful and 30% binger. I still have issues with perfection and fear of failure, but I do weird stuff for that I will talk about another time.




So, in closing, I hope you realize that fear and self-loathing does nothing but keep you stuck in a vicious circle that keeps you stagnant. You CAN lose weight if you are a binger—it absolutely can be done, but you have to change your mindset and your ideas of what success is.
