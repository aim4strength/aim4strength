What do American Ninja Warrior, Figure Competing, Powerlifting and marathon running all have in common? They are and have been my goals after losing my weight. These goals are pretty lofty, especially for an overweight, highly non-athletic, clumsy girl that had a hard time even walking to the cafeteria, and that is WITH motivation!

I knew when I was losing my weight I would have a hell of a time keeping it off. I know in my own mind –  bigger is better, more is better – and that includes food, too. I had to be methodical in my weight loss when doing this contest. I mentioned previously that I started walking, which, by the way, for a large person hurts like hell. I knew, though, that I needed some kind of exercise and I needed to start right away. Once I entered the contest, I also started weight watchers and a walking group.

The first time I was going to walk in the walking group, they had already started their prep for a marathon, and they were all going 5 miles. I was terrified! “How can a 300 pound person walk 5 miles?” I immediately called my husband and told him “I can’t do this; they are walking so far!”. His response? “Just come home, we are both fat, it’s not a big deal”. I was SO mad! “Does he not think I can do it? Did he just say I was fat and his underlying tone was that we would be fat for the rest of our lives?” Oh, HELL NO!

I walked about one mile, and crawled the rest of the way, and let me tell you, it was the worst and the best day of my life. The worst, because of the obvious pain and suffering, and the best because at the end (no, I didn’t need an ambulance ride… although, it would have been nice) I realized that I pushed through. I did it. It may have taken 5 hours, but dammit, I did it! I became a running junkie—ok, well, let’s not go that far. I became a walking junkie that interspersed some running in at times.

I made a lot of mistakes on my journey, but I have to say, I was proudest when I stuck with something after the going got tough. Once I lost my weight, I was scared because I didn’t know how to keep it off. It was really scary to think about the pressure of keeping my weight off for EVER. I decided to make HUGE goals that I didn’t know if I could accomplish. So, I ran a 1/2 marathon every month for a year. I was the Forrest Gump of fat people. And just like Forrest Gump, one day I just…. stopped. I saw that for me, running was leaving me gaunt and I still had lots of extra skin. Was I fit? I was always tired—at my top training regimen I was running 40 miles a week on 1300 calories—what the hell was I thinking? I was having cardiac arrhythmias and fatigue and felt like crapola.

Hence the figure competition idea was born. I will save that for another day, but just a teaser—I did it! I found that you don’t have to be super talented in a sport. You have to have heart. Genetics and ability give you a better edge, but it’s the heart that gets you where you want to go. It is the “want”, and the “drive” that lead to success. So to all of you that are scared to try something new and scary—just know that DRIVE is what propels you to the top. Being better than you were yesterday with driven purpose makes you a better and more capable person. So go out and do something that scares you every day. It is absolutely intimidating, you may feel like a total dweeb, it’s frightening—but you will never feel more alive.
