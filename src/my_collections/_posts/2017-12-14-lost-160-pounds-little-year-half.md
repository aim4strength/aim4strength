Yes, folks, it can be done, I am living proof.  You _can_ lose weight over 40.  Hell, you can lose weight at _any age._

I have been an overweight person my whole life.  Like, for real.  I was a fat kid, a fat teen and a fat adult.  At my largest I was 300 pounds, a size 28 and a 5 x in tops.  I was a big girl, for sure…

**If you are overweight, you probably can feel my pain.**

I was worried about all kinds of things—will I be able to fit in that booth at the restaurant, will I be able to get a seat belt extender for the plane, the list goes on….

It was not only annoying, but downright embarrassing.  I remember going into the store to buy groceries and a little blue-haired lady came up to me and indignantly said, “I don’t think you need these cookies.” She promptly took them out of my basket.  I was beyond embarrassed.

I wanted to crawl in a hole and never come out.

I really plodded through life _knowing_ that I would never be a “normal-sized” person.  There was no hoping anymore; I lost that a long time ago.

Until…

I entered a workplace contest.  For money.  Because….I really liked money.  I expected to lose weight and gain it right back; however, the contest was for an extended period of time-6 months.

I had never done a weight loss challenge for that amount of time.  I was worried about how I was going to do and knew that I needed more than a diet.

**I needed a plan.**

So, I set my brain afire with a plan on how to lose weight in order to win that money.  Yes, I knew how to get it off fast, but how do I do it so it will stay off for 6 months?

The first thing I did was to decide how I was going to eat.

What diet to choose was the bane of my existence for many years.  I had a hard time eating anything other than fast food and chocolate.  How the hell was I going to do it?

**I picked a plan I felt I could stick to.**  I started Weight Watchers.  They have an excellent program that gives you some freedom to pick what you want to eat and count your points. I liked that they had guidelines, meetings and educational info.

With that done, I knew I also needed something to get me moving—and I am not talking about changing the channel or walking to the refrigerator either.  I had to get serious and get serious fast…

**What do I like to do as far as exercise? **

Duh-who likes to exercise?  Ewww.  I really had to think long and hard about this.  I had always wanted to be a runner in school, but sucked at it.

Anything else was pretty intimidating because it had me going into a gym where I wasn’t too sure I could  even fit into the machines.

I thought long and hard, and felt this was my best option.  I knew I would have to walk first, and that was a lot less intimidating then gym work.

**I started to exercise with a local running group.** The accountability was important to me, because obviously I had issues with it and knew that for the first few months I needed someone to push me.

I started walking at first, and let me tell you, (no filter) it was absolutely horrid my first day.  I walked 5 miles and thought I was going to die.  But I didn’t die, and I kept going.

Eventually I did 1 full marathon and more than 25 half-marathons during my running journey.

**Now what?** Well, the next thing I did was to become the town cryer.  I told everyone about this contest.  I am talking _everyone._ From my hairdresser, to my family to the guy with the lazy eye at the grocery store-I told them all in detail what I had to do.

I didn’t want to, believe me, I wanted to keep it secret, because if I failed, there would be no one staring and me thinking I was a big fat loser.

I am sure you are saying to yourself, ok, thats all well and good, but how did you _stay_ on it?

Let me tell you, that was the biggest challenge for me and for anyone that has started a diet plan or an exercise plan-how in the hell do you stay on it?

**The biggest thing I did besides the obvious diet and exercise changes was being ok with failure.**

I am sure you are saying to yourself, come on, you have got to be kidding me—be ok with failure?  Umm, I want to be successful, why in the world are you talking about failing?

However,  failure is thing for me. Failing made me the way I was and I didn’t want to be the way I was—at least I didn’t for a 6 month period of time.

But, I also knew myself well.  I knew that failure was gonna happen.  I mean, come on, its 6 months!  That is a long time to go without cake, if you know what I am saying…

**So, I created the 49/51% rule.** This rule has absolutely, unequivocally saved my live and was the defining factor in _keeping my weight off_. Here is the deal.  I liked that I had accountability in the Weight Watchers group and my running group, but I knew at some point failure would happen.

I also knew how I have reacted to failure in the past—I dove head first into a chocolate cake, thats how I reacted.  So, the 49/51 % rule was like a built-in fail-safe.

I mean, if I knew I was going to fail and expected it and planned for it, then it wouldn’t be as disappointing.

**So, for 4 days out of the week I was super strict on the Weight Watchers plan, and 3 days out of the week, well, not so much.**

Now, don’t get me wrong—I didn’t eat a whole cake every day on the three days I was “off plan.”  I actually ate pretty close to what I ate in the days I was on; with one caveat—if we were going out or I was craving something, I ate it.

If I craved chips, I had some.  Some days I had half the bag, and some days only a few.  I still constrained myself, but gave myself more leeway on those three days than I did on the 4 days when I was super strict.

Yes I hit plateaus.  Yes, I got frustrated and wanted to quit at least once a week.  But I was losing weight at a steady pace.

It didn’t come off as fast as it would have if I was on a fad diet, and in my mind, that was frustrating, but I soldiered on.

After a year and a half, I stepped on the scale, and to my delight I was 138 pounds.  I was over the moon about it.  I will leave the next chapter of my journey to my next blog post….

**Lets recap, shall we?**

Pick a “diet plan” you can do and doesn’t leave you in binge mode.  Then, pick an exercise you like and have always wanted to do.

Once those are done, tell everyone, even the guy with the lazy eye at the grocery store.  The last and most important part—realize you will fail and implement a way to mitigate how you feel about failure.

Be totally consistent.

Viola, weight loss accomplished!
