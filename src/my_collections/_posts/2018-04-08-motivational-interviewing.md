Tony Robbins, Jim Rohn and Mel Robbins are all pretty motivational.  I listen to them, watch them and love what they do; however I do find that sometimes it doesn’t help me in my own life.  I don't know if this is because I am not “getting it” or the problem is deeper.



I am specifically talking about binge eating.  Yes, an uncomfortable subject, to say the least.  Sorry to make you squirm, but really it’s a thing—or at least it is in my world.



I was a binge eater since the time I was 5.  I was placed on a diet at that time due to me being “husky” and I felt overwhelmed and to be honest, freaking hungry!  Limiting my diet at that young age left me hoarding food well into my 40’s and the mindset is still a hard one to break.



If you are experiencing food hoarding, binge eating, binge eating and purging, this is the blog post for you-dedicated to you, actually.  I am usually pretty humorous (well, I would like to think so) however, I know how serious this topic is, so I will save my humorous sarcasm for another post….



If you are experiencing any of the above things, its important for me to say this—I am not a counselor nor do I have a degree in eating disorders.  I am not a clinician that deals with clients that have these disorders.  However, I myself have experienced these issues for most of my life and I can tell you some things from experience that maybe a highly trained clinician can only understand through a medical lens.  



Some things that I see when people are experiencing these issues are  lack of self esteem.  Happy on the outside but at home alone, totally not.  I know that at one point I was suicidal, slept 10 to 14 hours a day and just feel off the grid with my whole life.  Depression took over, and I no longer felt really anything.  I just didn’t engage in my life at all.  This happened for a period of years, and it was difficult on my family to say the least.  I just felt like I was barely keeping my head above water and even though I was busy, I was lonely.  So so lonely.  



I went to counselors, did scream therapy, talk therapy, yoga, meditation , etc.  When I was younger my mom took me to a neurologist and had me crawl around. On the ground.  For hours.  It didn’t help curb my appetite like it was supposed to, but I CAN say I can crawl under barbed wire like a boss, so there is that.



No matter your background, no matter your issues, if you are looking for a counselor or even a treatment center, these are some of the things you want to look for.  I say you, because you want a counselor or a trainer to be able to help you with your addiction. Yes, addiction.  Food can be an addiction.  Honestly, anything can be.  If you have an unhealthy relationship with food, and you get a dopamine rush when cake comes on the scene, you may have issues very similar to alcoholism. 



What is motivational interviewing?  



Builds a bond between you and them.

Help you eval the root of your addiction.

Helps you participate in the treatment plan and take more control in your own life

Helps you to take responsibility for your actions

Helps you control your own recovery process



Often you may not even realize you are in denial.  Some of the things you want to be aware of before you decide to change a behavior that you don't like is:



Evaluation: don't Are you resistant to change?  Are you deflecting your problems?  This is where you have to really do some soul searching.  Admitting you have a problem is the first step—I know it sounds corny but its true.



Preparation:  You have decided to get help, even if you really don't want to.  You map out some changes you want to make and you know that you have problems. This is the time that you set goals with a counselor or someone schooled in food addiction.



Action: Now you're fully engaged and on board-you are committed to recovery and decide to modify behavior in a constructive way.  You continue with receiving help in making good decisions.



Maintenance:  You now are making your own good decisions and now is just guided as needed.  



This seems super simplistic, however, these steps can be difficult and it may take you quite some time to get there.  



It is important to find someone who jives with you.  You want to have a connection to whomever is helping you
