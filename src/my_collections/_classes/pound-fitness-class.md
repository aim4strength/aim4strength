If you have ever wanted to be a drummer, this is the class for you. POUND® is an energizing cardio session using weighted drum sticks. In a POUND® class you don’t just hear the music, you actually jam with the music. It is a fun approach to getting excellent exercise and can help you burn up to 450 calories in a single 30-minute session.  Your instructor, Julie Smith, is a POUND PRO® and can help you have fun while getting fit.  Don’t know how to drum, no problem! We will teach you everything you need to know.
