Aim4Strength was founded by Julie Smith as a result of her own personal transformation. Julie, who spent most of her life as a Nurse being morbidly obese, lost over 160 lbs in her 40’s.

After her transformation, Julie realized that there are many people who are overwhelmed by the prospect of losing weight, intimidated to workout at a gym, and frustrated by the lack of results from quick fixes. These are all sentiments that Julie experienced during her journey as well.

It is Julie’s passion and determination that allowed her to reach her personal goals, and she instills that confidence and determination in every client she works with. She knows what it is like to be in her client’s position, because she has personally traveled that road herself.
