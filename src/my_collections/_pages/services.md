## About / Services

A4S mission statement maybe isn’t a true mission statement; however, it IS what this company is founded on—bringing strength to others who are in need of it.  I am not talking physical strength per se, but an overall strength of self that comes from having to go through the trials of life which can sometimes leave us  scarred and battered.   A4S wants to bring to others a sense of self love that was not there before through tests of physical strength and also by helping one work through their own unique inner conflicts that keep us unhappy and in a place that we don’t want to be in.  A4S does this by not only challenging each client physically, but by working together with each client to find their  personal strengths AND their weaknesses so that they can work on their individual life path. Each person is a unique individual and as such each client is treated uniquely.  The goals of A4S is to help bring out a clients individual strength, whether it be Spartan racing or getting out of a chair to walk across a room.  One is not better than the other—each is an individual goal that is obtained through hard work and goal setting.
