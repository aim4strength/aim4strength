## Personalized <br> Fitness Training

At Aim4Strength Fitness we offer personalized in-home fitness training for clients who are looking to transform their lives. Our programs are tailored to each client’s specific goals and objectives and workouts are modified to accommodate any existing medical conditions.

Aim4Strength’s in-home service allows clients to workout at their specific pace and in the comfort of their home. Aim4Strength works with clients to help them realize their potential to transform their lives physically, mentally and spiritually. A weight loss journey is as much physical as it is mental, and at Aim4Strength we ensure both aspects are given equal attention.

Aim4Strength was founded by Julie Smith as a result of her own personal transformation. Julie, who spent most of her life as a Nurse being morbidly obese, lost over 160 lbs in her 40’s.

After her transformation, Julie realized that there are many people who are overwhelmed by the prospect of losing weight, intimidated to workout at a gym, and frustrated by the lack of results from quick fixes. These are all sentiments that Julie experienced during her journey as well.

It is Julie’s passion and determination that allowed her to reach her personal goals, and she instills that confidence and determination in every client she works with. She knows what it is like to be in her client’s position, because she has personally traveled that road herself.
