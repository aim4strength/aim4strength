A Foodies Guide to Whole30

I love food. Really. But not in a stuff-your-face kind of way, it’s definitely quality over quantity. I love to enjoy well thought out and well prepared food. I’m pretty sure that I have a degree in cookery from all the hours of Food Network I have logged, back before they were all game shows and showdowns. (Emeril 5 times a day anyone?). It’s my artistic outlet I suppose.

When I looked at Whole30, I knew it would be a challenge. How in the world would I eliminate practically everything but the basics and survive? In the eat-to-live or live-to-eat world, I am definitely the latter. I couldn’t imagine NOT enjoying my daily sustenance for 30 whole days. What kind of life is that? Not one I was interested in, that’s for sure.

But I also was curious how my body would respond to such an experiment. So I had a choice…give up all enjoyment of one of my favorite things in life or approach it from a “crack the code” mindset. Again, the latter prevailed. I printed off do’s and don’ts lists, hung them on my fridge and got down to business. I was going to do this thing AND still enjoy my life…which involves enjoying my meals.

The first thing I tackled was breakfast.

I have always eaten breakfast. If I drink coffee and follow it up with a donut or nothing, I’m going to be a jittery mess inside of 10 minutes. Breakfast has always been the thing that gets me up and running. So I started here, with the most important meal of the day. Checking the list I discovered that potatoes are actually allowed. Sweet potatoes, yams and now even white potatoes are fully compliant. AWESOME. I can totally work with that!

Here are a few recipes developed for the breakfast lover in all of us:

Batch Baked Potatoes

Turn on your oven to 350. Wash and dry an assortment of white and sweet potatoes that are relatively the same size and shape. Place them in the oven (right on the rack is fine) and let them bake for 45 minutes or so. When a knife can be inserted without resistance, they are done. You are now ready for a weeks worth of quick and easy breakfasts.

Sweet Potato Porridge

Heat 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk in a medium sized pot. While it is heating, split a baked sweet potato in half and scoop out the meat (or is it flesh?) and discard the skins. Add the sweet potato (about 1 to 1 ½ cups) to the heated milk and use a potato masher to combine. Thin with additional milk if needed to create a creamy consistency. Mix in 2 tablespoons of almond butter and blend well. Serve in a bowl and garnish with cinnamon and diced apple if desired.

Avocado Toast

Take 1 white baked potato and slice lengthwise into oval shaped disks, about ¼ inch thick, sprinkle one side with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon of ghee and 1 teaspoon olive oil in a nonstick skillet.  When the ghee and oil begin to ripple on the surface, place the potato slices seasoned side down into the pan. Season the other side.. Cook 3-5 minutes over medium-high heat, until golden brown and crispy and then carefully flip to cook the other side. Meanwhile, mash a ripe avocado in a bowl
