Holy cow!  Another week down and another week closer to getting that American Ninja Warrior application in….

I have to say that I am humming with excitement and all consuming terror at the thought of even turning in my application.  It's likely nothing will come of it, but……what if something does?

For me, this is almost as big as losing weight.  It feels like a goal that is totally outside my realm of achieve and I am having a hard time even picturing myself doing something so crazy.

I felt the same way that day I gave my money to be in a work place competition to win money.  I was totally panic-stricken.  The second I handed over my mulah, I wanted to eat my face off.

Self Sabotage

Oh come on—you guys have all done it.  You proclaim your going to get fit and healthy, and then you see a Popeyes and you just cant help diving face deep into some fried chicken.

We all have set ourselves up for failure at one time or another.  I have done this all my life and really am an expert at it.  In fact, I can self sabotage without even thinking about it, because I am so fearful about how to get to my goal.

Big goals, goals outside of our comfort zone or even little goals that freak you out can have you diving into a pint of  Ben&Jerry’s ice cream-and it doesn't have to be weight related goals, fitness goals or health goals.

It could be that you are doing a scary new project at work.  For me, meeting people I don't know makes me sick to my stomach and want to run crying to the nearest Carl’s Jr.

Here are some tips that help me when I am doing something really scary and want to ruin my own progress:

1.  Remember why you are doing what you are doing.  Write it down, talk to people about it, sing it to the world.  You will hate yourself for opening your big fat mouth, but it will make you disinclined to screw your own self over.  Its kind of a form of punishment as you are publicly shaming yourself if you don't do that scary thing, but hey, it works most of the time.

2.  Make a plan.  This one is very important.  You have to have a plan of attack.  This alleviates some stress and helps you to just “getter done.” Sometimes its just easier to follow a written plan that you or someone else made up to alleviate pressure.

3.  It's ok to be scared shitless.  Give yourself a break.  Allow yourself to feel that fear, but don't let it take over your whole life so you are paralyzed by it.  A little fear gives you a push in the right direction, being taken over by fear makes you stop in your tracks and basically holds you back from achieving your goals.

4.  Be self aware.  You may not even know that you are super afraid.  You may be like me and have a tendency to actually live life fearfully and in order to realize that you are being a cry baby, you actually have to look inward and talk to yourself about your fears daily.  Yes, I am the weirdo at the store that is muttering under her breath like I have an imaginary friend—“you can do it, Julie, don't be such a wuss, Julie, stop being a cry baby pee-pee pants, Julie….”

I have been fighting the rising fear ever since I said I was going to tryout for ANW.  I have been thwarting myself through diet by eating too much, I have been a bit paralyzed with fear and not doing what I know it will take in order to get to the next level physically.

So, here is where the buck stops.  I am putting my money where my mouth is and writing this to call myself out.  I have written out a plan of things to accomplish so that I can just rely on that and not think too much.

So, for all you failures, self saboteurs and “losers” out there—We have each others back.  We can change anything in our lives we want to, even do things that you may think are beyond your reach if we_ believe.  _We can do all this stuff together, and help each other be the best selves we can be.
