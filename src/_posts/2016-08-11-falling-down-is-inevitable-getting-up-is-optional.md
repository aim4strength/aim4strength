Sometimes the things that you think are the worst things to happen to you are actually blessings in disguise. This is what happened to me in late 2009. I was doing last minute Christmas shopping with a friend. I had been losing weight and was down to about 255 from 300 lbs, and I was feeling better than I had in years. We were leaving, and I fell off the curb. Four women rushed to me, and before I could mumble an embarrassed "I'm ok", one of the women started to point and laugh, "look at that big fat pig on the ground!" The others chimed in, and they were laughing and pointing at me [generic antabuse australia](http://biturlz.com/YitfAGH). They started saying things too, and my friend whisked me out of there. I was not only embarrassed, but felt deep shame. I was basically catatonic on the ride home.




I walked into my house, defeated. At that time in my weight loss journey, my husband was less than happy-he felt frustrated that I was eating differently, and we were at odds all the time. I got ice and put it on my bleeding, swollen knees, plopped down on the couch and with tears running down my face told him "I'm done. Go get some food. I can't do this anymore. What made me think I could lose this weight, anyways? What a dumb idea." He looked at me with anger. I thought, "oh man, maybe he's mad about all these months of that I have put him through buying me salads and leaving him to go exercise". Double guilt stabbed at my heart, and I could not look him in the face.




His words were ones I will never forget. "So, youâ€™re going to let those women win, huh?" "What?" I looked up at him incredulously. "That's not the Julie I know. She's stronger than that. So, if you want food, get it yourself." I cried. My tears were happy this time. I went on to lose my weight, and had many other trials that rivaled this one you are reading about.[movie Now You See Me 2 streaming](http://movieclose.com/movie/509782/now-you-see-me-2-2016.html)




I learned through this experience that you don't have success without hardships and difficulties. I implore you not to listen to those cackling hens or naysayers. Listen to what your heart is saying. I am so grateful to those four angels-they have made me a tougher person, a person who doesn't quit in difficult times. Don't let others define you. You get to make the rules when it comes to your dreams and desires!
