Are You a Poser?

Yes, I have lost a lot of weight, and I have kept it off.  I should feel all good about myself, right?  Well, actually I feel like a total poser.

Some days I feel like I am living a lie and that everyone will know that I am really fat inside. They will find out that *shocker* I still have issues with food…

Well, I am hear to tell you that you will likely always have that voice in your head when you reach your goal—the one that screams at you that you’re an imposter and you really don’t know what you’re talking about.

**That voice in your head is a total a-hole**

I know that I suffer through that voice on a daily basis.  If I listen to the voice, it gets stronger, but when I don’t its in the background, almost like white noise, if you will.

I thought for a long time that I was just on the crazy train-I mean only people with auditory hallucinations hear voices, right?  Um, nope.

I freaking love Mel Robbins, She is able to explain that voice inside your head better than anyone I have ever read.  [www.melrobbins.com](http://www.melrobbins.com).  She talks about the “imposter” syndrome and how to combat it.

**Ever Heard of a Little Thing Called Neuroplasticity?**

This is not neuroscience 101, promise….however, this does tie in with the imposter theme here, so bear with me.

So, neuroplasticity is defined as “lasting change to the brain throughout an individual's life course. “  This is per Wikipedia.

This means you may be an old dog, but you_ can _learn new tricks.  How that is applicable with the voice is very interesting.

So, you can _make_ new neural connections and you can_ break_ neural connections, too.  Lets say you have been fat all your life, and now, over the course of years have lost that weight and kept it off.

**But you have made new connections and habits, right?**

That voice in your head is like the remnant factor of your old self (which had a habit of being a dick to you) and that connection is still there.  It may be weak, but its still there.

Hence hearing that voice in your head that tells you that you don’t deserve to do well and basically you suck.

So, even though we made new connections, the old ones may still be present.  Weak, but still present.

**Here are some of my own tips to decrease the imposter syndrome:**



 	
  * Stop listening to that voice.  Like, go deaf to that horrid little naysayer _right this very minute!_


_   _It is easier said than done.  I still have that vixen telling me that I suck on a daily basis, and I

have to really concentrate on drowning her out either with another thought or just turn up my

music.



 	
  * Make your plan and stick to it.  If you don’t, she will get louder, call you all kinds of names, and try to derail your progress that you have made.  If I don’t write things down, I will likely become paralyzed to the she-devil voice and listen to it.  She loves when I am paralyzed with fear, and she gets louder.  I feel like I am back in 6th grade being tormented by a bully….



 	
  * When you fail, fall off the wagon, screw up, know that it is temporary.  If you are trying to become something better in your life, that voice will get louder, screaming that you are a big fat poser.  You have to remember that she is your insecurity talking.  She is still you, just with a fouler mouth and a ton more fears.  Be kind to her, but firm.  Drown her out kindly.  If you listen to her, don’t get pissed at yourself.  Just take a deep breath and regroup.  Then, shut that biotch down and ignore her.


The poser thing can happen over many years and have lots of layers-like an onion.  You try to look and act smart in math class, but you cant add 2+4 and get the right answer.  Poser!

You do that long enough, you know deep down that you are an imposter, but your mom expects you to make an “A” in the class.

Maybe you work hard and you finally have bugged your teacher so much that he gave you an “A” in the class because you have worked hard, even progressed on something you didn’t think you could.

Still, that voice screams how you are a faker, that you will be found out and exposed for the imposter you are.

It’s the same with anything you are striving to do well at.

If you are trying to achieve a skill that you didn’t possess before, and arrive at achieving the skill, you almost feel like someone will come along and tell you that you really don’t know what you are doing, that you are a poser.

Over time this voice will get harder to hear.  The poser thing stays with you for a long time only if you listen to the voice in your head that keeps that connection alive.

So, stop.  Regroup, stop listening to that voice and make a plan.  All of these will help drown out the voice and hopefully you will become deaf to her ramblings.

You got this!
