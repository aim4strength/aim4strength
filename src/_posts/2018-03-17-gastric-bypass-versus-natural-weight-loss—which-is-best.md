So, some of you here kinda know my story.  You know that I lost weight in a contest.  For money. My goal with the money (700 buckaroonies) was that I was going to go to Vegas and buffet hop…



It was going to be glorious.  However, that didn’t work out and I decided to keep going with my weight loss.  However, there is more to the story than that….



I actually wanted to have a gastric bypass. I was desperate to lose weight. My life was spiraling out of control and I was so scared I would end up 50, fat and incapacitated.  



I did some of the gastric bypass seminars and was trying to get fast-tracked through my insurance for a gastric bypass.  I actually was going to be enrolled in classes that you had to have in order to start the process of a gastric bypass.



I went to my physician at the time, and he was not only supportive, he was excited.  His sister had gone through the gastric bypass procedure and he said it changed her life. 



Unfortunately, I didn’t feel so hopeful….



I had seen clients die of the gastric bypass.  I had also seen great stories of success.  I was torn as to whether to do it or not.  Once I spoke with my doctor, that answer was crystal clear…



This is a recreation of my convo with my physician, although I have some memory issues, so its probably inaccurate as hell.



Doctor: You will be a perfect candidate for weight loss surgery!  You have no co-morbidities and you will do very well post op.

Me:  Great. (crying inside because I was thinking of all the cake I could no longer eat once I had the surgery.)

Doctor: My sister had the surgery and did remarkably well.  It changed her outlook on life and she is happier than I have ever seen her!

Me:  Great.  (still thinking of all the cake I can no longer eat and how I would be forced to eat smaller portions of everything.)

Doctor: I will talk to your insurance when the time comes and we will get you all set for getting that going!  Congratulations.

Me: Thanks.  (I am going into my car and turn it on, get carbon monoxide poisoning so I don’t have to struggle with this anymore.  After that, I am going to eat my damn cake in heaven…)

Doctor: Are you excited?

Me: Uh huh. (Can I run out of this office, flag down a baker so that I can hitch a ride out of here.

on my cake high? Stop asking me questions!!! Argh!)

Doctor: Well, your life will change with this.

Me: Yup. (Yeah, and not in a good way….I need to run out into traffic right now…)



This was actually what I was thinking the whole time I was conversing with him.  No, really.



If you know me, you know this is actually how I think.  Its sick, but whatever.  I was so freaking ready to get out of the office and didn’t really know what to do. 



I went home and cried my face off—and not the cute cry of a pretty woman—no, it was the ugly, snotty, splotchy-faced, heaving cry of someone that has lost her last chance.  



I really felt that I lost it.  It was gone.  Stepped on, ground into a fine powder.  I was so despondent that I called in sick to work the next day, stayed in bed all day, and just cried. 



 My last chance for life just went out the window.



THIS is how I knew that  a gastric bypass wasn’t for me. 



Do I think its wrong to do a gastric bypass for others?  Of course I don’t.  I feel that any type of weight loss surgery is a tool and nothing more.



You still have to keep weight off, deal with weight gain, do everything everyone in the free known world has to do to lose weight.  Duh. It’s not magic, and those who think it is are ill informed. 



These are some of the things you need to think about when you are looking into weight loss surgery:



 Are you totally out of control excited about it?  If you are and feel like this is your last chance to get the weight off, you need to see why.  Why are you excited about it?  Do you feel it will solve things in your life?  I have come to realize that my lack of enthusiasm was the defining factor in me deciding against weight loss surgery.  However, it is important to temper your excitement with realistic goals and know that this is only a tool that will help you in your weight loss journey.  Before you get all mad at me for trying to stamp out your excitement, I want you to be excited—I just want you to know that losing weight doesn’t define who you are, just makes who you are on the outside fit with who you are on the inside….

Research the crap out of it.  If you are getting an invasive procedure, you want to know what you are getting into.  Gastric bypasses are so yesterday, and it seems that gastric sleeves have taken their place. There are major risks to any surgery, and you need to know those risks and inform yourself. Don’t blindly do what someone else tells you—do your own research.  It doesn’t matter if that someone is your physician.  Ask a crap ton of questions, because this is your life and your body, not theirs. 

Don’t be in such a rush.  I mean, damn, you have been fat (I am assuming) for a long time.  I highly suggest that after you research the crap out of the surgery, research different physicians, know different procedures that are less invasive and really go in there with an agenda.  So what if you question the hell out of the physician?  If they get huffy, maybe you need to know why.  You can and should have second and third opinions. The more the merrier, because again, this is your body and you want to come out of this with no complications or issues.

Get a strategy.  Seriously, when you can eat solid food and eat a little more, there is a point where you need to have a strategy in place when you stop losing weight, hit a plateau or have lost all your weight and you don’t want to gain it back again.  Your head has to be in the game—period.  It doesn’t matter how you lost the weight, your still have a fat brain (or at least I still do) and still may think like a fat person.  I still have fat-person mentality even after 8 years, and have many strategies in place that keep me from gaining my weight back.  One strategy I employ is doing things that scare me physically.  Box jumps. Jumping out of an airplane.  Whatever it is, thats how I deal with it.  I get “ready” for any scary physical challenge, so I am always training for it.  It may be weird, but I AM weird, so it works for me.







Conclusion

This still isn’t a fool-proof way to keep weight off. You can eat through this just like you have eaten through feelings in the past.  I have seen many gain back their weight and are even more miserable than ever, and you don’t want to be that person.



Employing the above rules will help you really be engaged in your weight loss journey. Can you do it without surgery?  Of course you can. 



The thing is, you have to wrap your head around the fact that you can do anything you want.  You are not a victim and you are in control of what you put into your pie hole.  



If surgery is something you feel would be a good tool, do it—don’t let others put their judgements on you.  If you are like me and it freaked you out, then you know that this may not be your path.  



Your path may be that you need to do this naturally—and you CAN.  Do what your heart tells you.
