    <p>Sometimes the things that you think are the worst things to happen to you are actually blessings in disguise. This is what happened to me in late 2009. I was doing last minute Christmas shopping with a friend. I had been losing weight and was down to about 255 from 300 lbs, and I was feeling better than I had in years. We were leaving, and I fell off the curb. Four women rushed to me, and before I could mumble an embarrassed &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok&rdquo;, one of the women started to point and laugh, &ldquo;look at that big fat pig on the ground!&rdquo; The others chimed in, and they were laughing and pointing at me <a href="http://biturlz.com/YitfAGH">generic antabuse australia</a>. They started saying things too, and my friend whisked me out of there. I was not only embarrassed, but felt deep shame. I was basically catatonic on the ride home.</p>

<p>I walked into my house, defeated. At that time in my weight loss journey, my husband was less than happy-he felt frustrated that I was eating differently, and we were at odds all the time. I got ice and put it on my bleeding, swollen knees, plopped down on the couch and with tears running down my face told him &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done. Go get some food. I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. What made me think I could lose this weight, anyways? What a dumb idea.&rdquo; He looked at me with anger. I thought, &ldquo;oh man, maybe he&rsquo;s mad about all these months of that I have put him through buying me salads and leaving him to go exercise&rdquo;. Double guilt stabbed at my heart, and I could not look him in the face.</p>

<p>His words were ones I will never forget. &ldquo;So, you’re going to let those women win, huh?&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I looked up at him incredulously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the Julie I know. She&rsquo;s stronger than that. So, if you want food, get it yourself.&rdquo; I cried. My tears were happy this time. I went on to lose my weight, and had many other trials that rivaled this one you are reading about.</p>

<p>I learned through this experience that you don&rsquo;t have success without hardships and difficulties. I implore you not to listen to those cackling hens or naysayers. Listen to what your heart is saying. I am so grateful to those four angels-they have made me a tougher person, a person who doesn&rsquo;t quit in difficult times. Don&rsquo;t let others define you. You get to make the rules when it comes to your dreams and desires!</p>
