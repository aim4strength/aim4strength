    <p>Yes, folks, it can be done, I am living proof.  You <u>can</u> lose weight over 40.  Hell, you can lose weight at <u>any age.</u></p>

<p>I have been an overweight person my whole life.  Like, for real.  I was a fat kid, a fat teen and a fat adult.  At my largest I was 300 pounds, a size 28 and a 5 x in tops.  I was a big girl, for sure…</p>

<p><strong>If you are overweight, you probably can feel my pain.</strong></p>

<p>I was worried about all kinds of things—will I be able to fit in that booth at the restaurant, will I be able to get a seat belt extender for the plane, the list goes on….</p>

<p>It was not only annoying, but downright embarrassing.  I remember going into the store to buy groceries and a little blue-haired lady came up to me and indignantly said, “I don’t think you need these cookies.” She promptly took them out of my basket.  I was beyond embarrassed.</p>

<p>I wanted to crawl in a hole and never come out.</p>

<p>I really plodded through life <u>knowing</u> that I would never be a “normal-sized” person.  There was no hoping anymore; I lost that a long time ago.</p>

<p>Until…</p>

<p>I entered a workplace contest.  For money.  Because….I really liked money.  I expected to lose weight and gain it right back; however, the contest was for an extended period of time-6 months.</p>

<p>I had never done a weight loss challenge for that amount of time.  I was worried about how I was going to do and knew that I needed more than a diet.</p>

<p><strong>I needed a plan.</strong></p>

<p>So, I set my brain afire with a plan on how to lose weight in order to win that money.  Yes, I knew how to get it off fast, but how do I do it so it will stay off for 6 months?</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to decide how I was going to eat.</p>

<p>What diet to choose was the bane of my existence for many years.  I had a hard time eating anything other than fast food and chocolate.  How the hell was I going to do it?</p>

<p><strong>I picked a plan I felt I could stick to.</strong>  I started Weight Watchers.  They have an excellent program that gives you some freedom to pick what you want to eat and count your points. I liked that they had guidelines, meetings and educational info.</p>

<p>With that done, I knew I also needed something to get me moving—and I am not talking about changing the channel or walking to the refrigerator either.  I had to get serious and get serious fast…</p>

<p><strong>What do I like to do as far as exercise? </strong></p>

<p>Duh-who likes to exercise?  Ewww.  I really had to think long and hard about this.  I had always wanted to be a runner in school, but sucked at it.</p>

<p>Anything else was pretty intimidating because it had me going into a gym where I wasn’t too sure I could  even fit into the machines.</p>

<p>I thought long and hard, and felt this was my best option.  I knew I would have to walk first, and that was a lot less intimidating then gym work.</p>

<p><strong>I started to exercise with a local running group.</strong> The accountability was important to me, because obviously I had issues with it and knew that for the first few months I needed someone to push me.</p>

<p>I started walking at first, and let me tell you, (no filter) it was absolutely horrid my first day.  I walked 5 miles and thought I was going to die.  But I didn’t die, and I kept going.</p>

<p>Eventually I did 1 full marathon and more than 25 half-marathons during my running journey.</p>

<p><strong>Now what?</strong> Well, the next thing I did was to become the town cryer.  I told everyone about this contest.  I am talking <u>everyone.</u> From my hairdresser, to my family to the guy with the lazy eye at the grocery store-I told them all in detail what I had to do.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to, believe me, I wanted to keep it secret, because if I failed, there would be no one staring and me thinking I was a big fat loser.</p>

<p>I am sure you are saying to yourself, ok, thats all well and good, but how did you <u>stay</u> on it?</p>

<p>Let me tell you, that was the biggest challenge for me and for anyone that has started a diet plan or an exercise plan-how in the hell do you stay on it?</p>

<p><strong>The biggest thing I did besides the obvious diet and exercise changes was being ok with failure.</strong></p>

<p>I am sure you are saying to yourself, come on, you have got to be kidding me—be ok with failure?  Umm, I want to be successful, why in the world are you talking about failing?</p>

<p>However,  failure is thing for me. Failing made me the way I was and I didn’t want to be the way I was—at least I didn’t for a 6 month period of time.</p>

<p>But, I also knew myself well.  I knew that failure was gonna happen.  I mean, come on, its 6 months!  That is a long time to go without cake, if you know what I am saying…</p>

<p><strong>So, I created the 49/51% rule.</strong> This rule has absolutely, unequivocally saved my live and was the defining factor in <u>keeping my weight off</u>. Here is the deal.  I liked that I had accountability in the Weight Watchers group and my running group, but I knew at some point failure would happen.</p>

<p>I also knew how I have reacted to failure in the past—I dove head first into a chocolate cake, thats how I reacted.  So, the 49/51 % rule was like a built-in fail-safe.</p>

<p>I mean, if I knew I was going to fail and expected it and planned for it, then it wouldn’t be as disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>So, for 4 days out of the week I was super strict on the Weight Watchers plan, and 3 days out of the week, well, not so much.</strong></p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong—I didn’t eat a whole cake every day on the three days I was “off plan.”  I actually ate pretty close to what I ate in the days I was on; with one caveat—if we were going out or I was craving something, I ate it.</p>

<p>If I craved chips, I had some.  Some days I had half the bag, and some days only a few.  I still constrained myself, but gave myself more leeway on those three days than I did on the 4 days when I was super strict.</p>

<p>Yes I hit plateaus.  Yes, I got frustrated and wanted to quit at least once a week.  But I was losing weight at a steady pace.</p>

<p>It didn’t come off as fast as it would have if I was on a fad diet, and in my mind, that was frustrating, but I soldiered on.</p>

<p>After a year and a half, I stepped on the scale, and to my delight I was 138 pounds.  I was over the moon about it.  I will leave the next chapter of my journey to my next blog post….</p>

<p><strong>Lets recap, shall we?</strong></p>

<p>Pick a “diet plan” you can do and doesn’t leave you in binge mode.  Then, pick an exercise you like and have always wanted to do.</p>

<p>Once those are done, tell everyone, even the guy with the lazy eye at the grocery store.  The last and most important part—realize you will fail and implement a way to mitigate how you feel about failure.</p>

<p>Be totally consistent.</p>

<p>Viola, weight loss accomplished!</p>
