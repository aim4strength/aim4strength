    <p>I was asking my husband what subject I should write about for my blog.  His answer took me by surprise.  “Write about why women hate themselves and men don’t.”  “We don’t hate ourselves,” I said, my voice an octave higher.  “See, you even get defensive over it.  You women hate yourselves.  You will never catch a man getting all emotional with a few lines on his face or a beer gut. We just don’t think like that.”</p>

<p>He may be right.  It might be my imagination, but I think that women are targeted more through marketing and the media to look, act and feel a certain way.  I mean, geez, just look at TV ads—most are targeted to us about our hair, face, skin and weight.  Men?  Well, they get cool commercials like Tums.  Its always a guy that ate that pizza and now is paying for it.  Or what about this one—Enzyte—we all know carefree “Bob” who waves at his neighbors and has a catchy tune to his male enhancement advertisement.  Come to think of it, thats my husbands ring tone….</p>

<p>Anyways, I really had to think about it.  Yes, I guess I am a little defensive about it.  Maybe he is right about women not ever being satisfied with themselves.  I mean, if you get a room full of women together, they usually end up talking about their hair, skin, or body in some way and its usually negative in nature.  If they are menopausal like myself, they are talking about facial hair, the hormone pellet and how many things are going south forever and not just for the winter.</p>

<p>How in the world can we change our way of thinking, then,  to become more satisfied with ourselves?  What I propose is radical and over the top.  Serious, life changing stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stop watching TV.  Yup.  Turn off that boob tube.  If you have to, get it out of the room.  In truth, you are actually being brainwashed.  I know, a little extreme.  But is it?  Marketers know that if you hear an ad the first time, its likely not going to phase you.  The 330th  time you hear it,  though, may compulsively call you to buy their product or service. Everyone is susceptible to that, man or woman.  However, I believe that the bulk of products (well, maybe not Enzyte) are being targeted toward women.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete Instagram and Facebook.  Another crazy, over the top thing to do.  However-I can tell you what I do on instagram.  I look at other girls.  No, not in a sleazy way. I do it to compare myself.  I like this girls butt.  I want to have so-in-so’s legs.  What do they eat in a day?  Why does my life suck compared to theirs?  I really don’t see dudes doing that.  If my husband had all these other good-looking men on his instagram and said “hey, do you think I could look like him if I go to the gym more?”  It would totally creep me out.  I do that to him all the time, though. Now, I am not talking forever.  Just a short time.  Maybe a week, maybe a month.  A break may be needed especially if you take an hour or two out of your day just to see other women doing  duck-lipped selfies and sticking their amazing booties out for all the world to see.</p></li>
<li><p>When you think of a negative comment to say to yourself, stop.  Think about how you are bombarded every day with marketing ads that tell you that you aren’t good enough, pretty enough or smart enough.  Just be kind to yourself.  How about you tell yourself something nice?  Something like, “I have a lovely nose.”  Then <u>stop</u> there.  Don’t say “I have a lovely nose, its way better than Marthas.”  That is a comparison.  Also, its kind of mean.  So stop comparing and stop being mean, especially to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Hang with people that care about you, not what you look like or what you have. Yup. For years I hung out with takers, people who made me feel dirty and crappy about myself. They sucked me dry and made me feel like i wasn’t worth much. This happened especially when I was at my top weight of 300 pounds.  I have to say, the fault was mine.  I felt like I was nothing, so I was ok with being treated like I was nothing.  Had I thought higher of myself, then I certainly wouldn’t have wasted my time on people that didn’t have my best interest at heart.</p></li>
<li><p>Wake up and think of 3 things you are grateful for.  Like, <u>every single day.</u> Sometimes, it can be hard, especially if you are the “glass half empty” kind of gal.  Its amazing how far this seemingly stupid step can be.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It makes me sad that I spent a better part of my life trying to please others. I do believe we place too much value on what we see through the media—because we all know Big Boob Barbie who lives in a beach house in Malibu is the happiest person in the world and has an amazing life—until breaking news finds her broke, living the homeless life in LA with a slight meth habit she developed living the good life in Malibu.  So, value YOU.  You are unique.  You are cool, weird, quirky or some other adjective that can be inserted to suit what makes up…well, <u>you</u>.  Don&rsquo;t be self-loathing, because the one person that should be in your corner all the time is <u>you</u>.</p>
