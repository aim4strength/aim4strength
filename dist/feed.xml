&lt;p&gt;Man, its Monday again, and you are re-starting your diet…again.  I have been on this hamster wheel a time or two, and I would love nothing more than to help you off of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I always thought you had to be motivated to lose weight.  I would watch my favorite person in the world, Richard Simmons and get so hyped about losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would food prep, get ready on the weekend for Monday and swear that this time, this time would be the time I would totally lose my weight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday would roll around, and I would fall off the wagon.  I would feel terrible and swear, next Monday, I will totally get in the groove, this was just a “pre-start.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lied to myself for years, slowly but surely chinking away at trusting myself to do any type of follow through when it came to my body.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a hot body.  I wanted to eat cake.  Wow, I had a huge dilemma.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I was 40, I was depressed, my mobility was limited and I had to pick up my stomach to pee.  Talk about hitting an all-time low—I mean, when you gotta pick up your skin to do anything so basic as peeing its pretty demeaning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets talk Motivation 101&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell is the difference, anyway?  Is it someone jumping around on a couch yelling at you? Or a quiet person you see as a mentor that you want to emulate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is my take.  You cannot motivate anyone but yourself.  If you think about it, the person who is on fire doing stuff to get better-well, it is likely they are self motivated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only they know their reasons, but they are doing stuff because it means something to them. It can be sparked by another person that they admire, but to go the distance, it has to be an intrinsic need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you are thinking right now-what if you want something, but the situation isn’t changing?  Tough love here—then you don’t want it bad enough to change your habits.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you don’t “feel” motivated?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop. Right. There.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times you may not be excited to change.  You may not be…gasp…motivated.  Well, thats A-OK.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just have to want something bad enough to change your habits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I didn’t want to stop eating crap.  I cried when I had to change my diet.  I wasn’t hyped at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I had resigned myself to it for the weight-loss contest to do it for 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted the money.  I needed the money. I wanted the money so much I was willing to lose weight for it, change my diet and start with an exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some haters out there—mostly the people in my family that said this would be fleeting.  I admit, I thought so, too, because I was not doing it for the noble reasons that society told me to: health, wellness, or to get that “bikini” body…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what if your “want” isn’t what you should want by societies standards?  Well, I say tell them all to go crap in their hat and leave you be.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your motivation may come from wanting to wear a total slutty dress at your high school reunion so you can make the football star (the guy who now has a beer gut, no hair with a plumbers crack and yellow teeth), to be ashamed he trash-canned you in high school.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to lose weight to make your mate jealous.  Maybe you do want to be healthy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your reasons are yours alone, so who gives a crap about what other people think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation comes from your why.  Motivation is intrinsic.  Motivation is deciding to change your habits to create an environment conductive to meeting your goal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that Motivation comes from others outside of yourself—That person cannot change your habits, cry when you fall off the wagon, cry when you go back on the wagon, and cry because you are so happy you met your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiration 101&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiration is something that you feel inside; again, intrinsic in nature.  It may be a sudden thought that changes your actions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think inspiration is a cousin to motivation for sure, but again I feel inspiration is more a creative thing versus motivation which is something that kick starts you to change.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know when you get a lightbulb moment? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been plugging away at a problem by changing your habits and working hard, then all of a sudden an easier more creative way to go about the problem wakes you up in the middle of the night—Blamo! That is inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freaking love inspiration, because it can come at any time and it actually motivates you to be or do something better.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiration is cool because you can create it yourself. You can do it by thinking of a problem before you go to bed or trying to do things a million ways and seeing what sticks to the wall.  Thinking of a problem creatively makes you even more….Creative.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird how that works, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all these things are great and all, but wheres the beef, so to speak?  How do I lose weight, improve my life or make a big change in my job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the meaty parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop trying to find outside motivation. It needs to come from you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop thinking you will feel like doing stuff.  You take a deep breath and just do what you need to do.  It sucks.  I am not even gonna lie.  It will suck—until you finish the task.  Then we will have to take the hinges off the door so that your head can fit through it, because you are gonna feel like a million bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make inspiration work for you by thinking about stuff you want solve right before bed. You are more susceptible to suggestion when you are tired, and that can be a bad thing or a good thing depending on what you are thinking about, I would imagine.  I find when I am working really hard to solve a problem, I am usually on overload.  When I walk away or go to bed that is usually when ideas start flowing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation and inspiration both come from you.  You can help it along by finding others that do make you motivated for that initial ball to start rolling; just know that it will still continue to be a lot of work, habit change and failure even when you do find an extrinsic motivator.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thats my little diddy on motivation and inspiration.  I hope this helped you in your quest to find a little man with a fro running around with tiny shorts and hugging people.  Oh wait, thats my motivation, not yours….Oops!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="motivation" /><category term="inspiration" /><category term="lose weight" /><category term="" /><summary type="html">Motivation Versus Inspiration</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/aim4strength/image/upload/v1514574376/motivation-exercise.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How I Lost the Weight and Kept it Off Step by Step</title><link href="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2018/01/how-i-lost-the-weight-and-kept-it-off-step-by-step/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I Lost the Weight and Kept it Off Step by Step" /><published>2018-01-04T08:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-01-04T08:00:00-08:00</updated><id>https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2018/01/how-i-lost-the-weight-and-kept-it-off-step-by-step</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2018/01/how-i-lost-the-weight-and-kept-it-off-step-by-step/">&lt;p&gt;How do you go about doing this weight loss thing, step by step?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I get this question all the time. How did you lose your weight? How have you kept it off? How did you start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a step by step blog on how I lost the weight and have kept it off for over 8 years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you may get some responses that you weren’t expecting—as did I when I first started out. Here is the abridged version of my story and what I did-step by step for my weight loss process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as many of you know or have read, I lost my weight at age 40 in a weight loss contest at work. I wanted the money to go to Vegas so that I could have a weekend of buffets, concerts and slots. The problem was, I couldn’t do a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a looonnnggg process—6 months long. I couldn’t do the cabbage soup diet or the military diet, or any other diet that you can’t sustain for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t panic like I would have before. I had really hit rock bottom. I had totally and completely failed at the weight loss thing for so long, I no longer had any hope of losing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I figured, I would win the money so I could live it up in Vegas. I figured I would be in a Hoover-round by the age of 50 and have oxygen by 55. I pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I was going to be a statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was freeing and super sad all at once. In my previous desperation, I had been accepted to get a gastric bypass, but I knew I would eat right through it. I was desperate at that time, but after accepting the fact that I was a loser and would be one my whole life, I had somewhat of a peace fall over me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more fad diets, no more disappointments. No more hope for my future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ship had sailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my new goal was to win the money. I did the weight loss thing just as a step to the money. I actually didn’t have any intention of keeping it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like absolutely none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did to lose 50 pounds in 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I needed to do stuff that was way different from what I had done previously. I needed to lose weight over a long period of time, so the quick fixes were out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hatched a plan so ridiculously stupid I KNEW it would work….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 49/51% rule was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I devised the 49/51% rule. My head was keeping me from weight loss. I knew that on every level, but never could change it. I was fat, not dumb!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule was only to be used for this contest only. I made sure NOT to get my hopes up. Hopes was too dangerous a thing to have, and there was no room for that in this contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would stay on my diet 51% of the time and 49% of the time I would cheat. O would go out for dinner or eat dessert. I gave myself permission to cheat without feeling guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the rule to reflect a week. It went like this—4 days out of the week I was ON POINT. Like, I did not deviate from my Weight Watchers ways AT ALL. The other 3 days out of the week, I was pretty liberal. I followed the Weight Watchers ways kinda, but if I was going out to eat, I got what I wanted. Dessert? Yes, please. Pasta? Duh, it’s the bomb—lets do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule helped me get over feeling like a total and complete failure. I wrote everything that I ate down, even when I screwed up. I may screw up on Tuesday, and that was cool, as long as the rest of the week reflected the 49/51% rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I also needed to move more. I refused to be gymtimidated, so I started a walking group. It was horrible, painful and wonderful all at the same time. 85 year old females were my nemesis out on the road way. They out walked me in every way. It was humiliating. However, I have a pretty competitive streak. I knew that if I couldn’t beat them, I could trip them, so there was that….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;sorrynotsorry.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life. I hated it. It was hard. I then went on to do well over 30 half-marathons and one full one. It became my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the 3 things I did to lose over 160 pounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ate right
Exercised.
I repeated the above two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is it. I joined Weight Watchers and the Loma Linda Lopers (a running/walking group) so that I would be held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screwed up a lot during this journey. I binge ate cake. I chickened out on a few races. I cried myself to sleep after a particularly hard eating day. I felt like a failure at least 50% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost 160 pounds doing the above. There was no special diet, no special pills no special workout I did that had me shedding pounds like a snake sheds skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me address that elephant in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I did not put on this list was my mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not feel like doing this crap. That is why this contest thing worked for me. I knew I would not feel like losing weight-I was in a mental jail of sorts when I started, and I knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew deep in my heart I would not be successful, but I did it anyway. How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, when you hit rock bottom, there isn’t a whole lotta places to go but up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is exactly why I wasn’t doing it for the weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ship had sailed in my mind. However, I could do it for money, though-there was no hopes and dreams in that. If I didn’t win, there was no down side. I wanted the money, but I didn’t need the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no pressure. There was no pain if I failed. It was just a “shrug and move on” kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will never feel like losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect time, no perfect way of eating, no perfect exercise that you can do to magically lose weight and keep it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically picked an eating plan and a walking group out of the air. If I would have picked a vegan eating plan and yoga, it would have worked too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don’t feel like it, but now, it’s a habit. Its ingrained that I exercise, that I eat right, that I do my morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I just plain move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days I eat too much. Some days I wake up and look at the lines on my face, the stretch marks on my ass and the extra skin on my legs and tell myself this lifestyle isn’t working.
It’s too hard and I want to eat cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I pad into the kitchen and make myself some oatmeal or protein cake and I remember why I like having my weight off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can cross my legs. I can sit in a restaurant and not worry that I can fit into a booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can get down on the floor with my grandkids. I don’t get winded walking to my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to shop in a fat person store. I can get clothes off the rack—and by the way—you don’t have to pay for each square inch if its off the rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, don’t get me started on how they make fat people clothes look hella ugly, and how much you have to pay for them. Incidentally, I wore sweatshirts with poodles on them because that is all I could find in my 5x size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop waisting time (see what I did with that??). You will never feel like doing it. Ever. So just start. Make it a habit. Do a diet plan or an exercise plan that you feel you will like and stick to for a while. You can always change it up, but only after you have done it for at least a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t throw shade at yourself. When you do this, you down your efforts and habits that you have made and it erases and demeans your hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just knock that crap off right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this. Motivation is overrated. Plodding and habit is where its at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, when you find that you no longer have to throw your stomach up over your shoulder to pee, I am pretty sure this will have you stoked and help propel you forward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="lose weight" /><category term="weight" /><summary type="html">How do you go about doing this weight loss thing, step by step?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/aim4strength/image/upload/v1515103287/keep-it-off.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Weight Loss New Years Resolutions</title><link href="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/weight-loss-new-years-resolutions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Weight Loss New Years Resolutions" /><published>2017-12-27T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/weight-loss-new-years-resolutions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/weight-loss-new-years-resolutions/">&lt;p&gt;So many diets, so little time….Weight loss new years resolutions.  It&amp;rsquo;s almost a cliche, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? I know, because I used to do them every year, and still look forward to a new start, if I am to be completely honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with every new start you have done, how many times have you failed?  I know I have failed many New Years Resolutions over the years.  Let me tell you why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because lasting change is hard to do &lt;u&gt;mic drop&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by this is that we go into a new years resolution with a ton of motivation and many dreams of reaching our goals—which is especially true for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become the norm to start a diet on January 1st of every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its like you are a freak of nature if you don’t have a New Years resolution every year…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So does that mean you should not make any New Years resolutions?  I mean, do you even keep them beyond March?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I say you &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; make New Year’s Resolutions.  I am sure that surprises you, but I am all for getting hyped for a new start and a new year.  I love the way it makes me feel, and I love that I get to start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caveat: you will have some bumps in the road.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do?  How do you navigate January’s “new year, new you” campaign?  How can you make it last for the_ whole_ year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get hyped all you want, but have a plan for when you screw up.  A plan is super important because you will fail and get all depressed and fall into a quart of Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s of you don’t have some sort of a strategy.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets say you decided to start a type of eating program, like a low carb high fat diet, or a lower calorie diet; whatever it may be.  Its day 35, and you want to throw a tantrum because you want chocolate, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you imbibe.  You eat so much, that you look 8 months pregnant.  Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where your exit plan comes into play—You ate the chocolate.  Smile about it.  You ate it, I hope you enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you forgive yourself and move on.  You go right back to the plan you were doing.  Thats right, you got it out of your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Don’t make it weird.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move on, get over it, and stop obsessing about how you screwed up.  What is done is done, its in the past. just like Rafiki says…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t start something you KNOW you can’t do. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all seen those people that are 400 pounds go to the gym, practically kill themselves with working out, and in a few days are in so much pain and suffering they feel like dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I have done this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we all have.  However, it doesn’t make you like exercise or dieting at all,  it doesn’t make it enjoyable and its something that you most likely cannot sustain for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a change that can be lasting and fit into your lifestyle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I am not letting you off the hook.  Make no mistake, you will have to change in order to….Change. Duh. It&amp;rsquo;s the Law of thermodynamics, or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story time….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to lose weight since I was 5.  I was fat all of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go on these crazy diets like the cabbage soup diet, the grapefruit diet and exercise so hard that I couldn’t walk the next day.  I could stay only stay on a diet or exercise program for only 20 days, tops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after I had given up dieting, lost all hope of losing weight, a little work place contest came into my life.  I knew if I was to win this contest I had to make some major changes, but changes that could fit into my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest was 6 months long, so doing a 20 day fast wasn’t gonna cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to make changes that I knew I could sustain for a 6 month period of time.  Long story short, that was 8 years ago.  I have kept off 160 pounds. Well, ok, more like 152 because of Christmas goodies…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do something you like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, another duh moment. You are going to be doing this for the long haul, so why punish yourself by eating kale all day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have to do things that you aren’t your jam, that is true.  However, why torture yourself all the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love ice-cream.  I love sweets.  I make sure they are in my life in one fashion or another, otherwise life isn’t worth it.  I know, it sounds so dramatic, but I AM pretty passionate about my chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I eat low cal versions of it.  For instance, if I want ice cream I eat Arctic Zero (150 cals a pint) or some other low calorie version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I want chocolate.  I have a ton of chocolate protein powder that I make all kinds of stuff with (MTS Whey is my fav—you can click on the link &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerfitness.com&quot;&gt;www.tigerfitness.com&lt;/a&gt; to get you some!) And that also completes my protein needs nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love lifting heavy.  I love yoga, and doing flexibility work, so I do that.  I try new stuff to add to my repertoire. If I like moving in ways I love, then it will be easier to get my ass to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect people to be negative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I said it.  The people in your life that love you the most may root for you at first, but when you start to change your ways for a period of time, you will get lots of pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean that don’t love you, it means they don’t like being affected, even if it is  collaterally with change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another story time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I had lost all of my weight and kept it off for a few years.  My husband was Mr. Negative Nancy.  He hated that I lost my weight, and even though he tried to be supportive at times, he hated that I changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was because I changed his life, not just mine.  I changed our movie dates that were surrounded by food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed our dinner dates now that I watched my weight.  I changed what we did for fun, because I wanted to be more active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collateral changes may not be welcomed by people who are closest to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive them, move on, and &lt;u&gt;do you, boo.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, you are changing yourself for the better, and you have to tell them that.  The biggest advice I can give you is to continue on your journey; be empathetic to their needs, but don’t give in to the negativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt; Believe me, its hard. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to an understanding with my husband that works well for us now.  I exercise my face off when he is not home or if he is running errands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t ask anymore for him to go with me—it&amp;rsquo;s not his thing-and thats cool, because it IS mine.  He doesn’t stop me from doing it, and I don’t rag at him for not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still go out for dinner, and I work it out—I look up stuff online before we go so I know what I can have.  I wish I could say I don’t plan anymore, but I do, and will likely do so for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So to wrap it up…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have humongous, crazy, weirdo goals.  Make them big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the whole New Years’ resolution thing—its awesome that you are motivated by the new year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realize that motivation fades and difficulties often accompany the work it takes to reach your goal, so have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doing the steps it takes to get to your goal, do things that are not so out of the realm for you.  Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t deviate from your goal, and don’t let others derail you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you screw up, get back on the wagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these things are something you can completely do with little tweaks to your day to day life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have lost a lot of weight, and I have kept it off.  I should feel all good about myself, right?  Well, actually I feel like a total poser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days I feel like I am living a lie and that everyone will know that I am really fat inside. They will find out that &lt;u&gt;shocker&lt;/u&gt; I still have issues with food…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I am hear to tell you that you will likely always have that voice in your head when you reach your goal—the one that screams at you that you’re an imposter and you really don’t know what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That voice in your head is a total a-hole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I suffer through that voice on a daily basis.  If I listen to the voice, it gets stronger, but when I don’t its in the background, almost like white noise, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for a long time that I was just on the crazy train-I mean only people with auditory hallucinations hear voices, right?  Um, nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freaking love Mel Robbins, She is able to explain that voice inside your head better than anyone I have ever read.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melrobbins.com&quot;&gt;www.melrobbins.com&lt;/a&gt;.  She talks about the “imposter” syndrome and how to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ever Heard of a Little Thing Called Neuroplasticity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not neuroscience 101, promise….however, this does tie in with the imposter theme here, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, neuroplasticity is defined as “lasting change to the brain throughout an individual&amp;rsquo;s life course. “  This is per Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you may be an old dog, but you &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; learn new tricks.  How that is applicable with the voice is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can &lt;u&gt;make&lt;/u&gt; new neural connections and you can_ break_ neural connections, too.  Lets say you have been fat all your life, and now, over the course of years have lost that weight and kept it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you have made new connections and habits, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That voice in your head is like the remnant factor of your old self (which had a habit of being a dick to you) and that connection is still there.  It may be weak, but its still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence hearing that voice in your head that tells you that you don’t deserve to do well and basically you suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even though we made new connections, the old ones may still be present.  Weak, but still present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some of my own tips to decrease the imposter syndrome:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop listening to that voice.  Like, go deaf to that horrid little naysayer &lt;u&gt;right this very minute!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier said than done.  I still have that vixen telling me that I suck on a daily basis, and I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have to really concentrate on drowning her out either with another thought or just turn up my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your plan and stick to it.  If you don’t, she will get louder, call you all kinds of names, and try to derail your progress that you have made.  If I don’t write things down, I will likely become paralyzed to the she-devil voice and listen to it.  She loves when I am paralyzed with fear, and she gets louder.  I feel like I am back in 6th grade being tormented by a bully….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you fail, fall off the wagon, screw up, know that it is temporary.  If you are trying to become something better in your life, that voice will get louder, screaming that you are a big fat poser.  You have to remember that she is your insecurity talking.  She is still you, just with a fouler mouth and a ton more fears.  Be kind to her, but firm.  Drown her out kindly.  If you listen to her, don’t get pissed at yourself.  Just take a deep breath and regroup.  Then, shut that biotch down and ignore her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poser thing can happen over many years and have lots of layers-like an onion.  You try to look and act smart in math class, but you cant add 2+4 and get the right answer.  Poser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do that long enough, you know deep down that you are an imposter, but your mom expects you to make an “A” in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you work hard and you finally have bugged your teacher so much that he gave you an “A” in the class because you have worked hard, even progressed on something you didn’t think you could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, that voice screams how you are a faker, that you will be found out and exposed for the imposter you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same with anything you are striving to do well at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to achieve a skill that you didn’t possess before, and arrive at achieving the skill, you almost feel like someone will come along and tell you that you really don’t know what you are doing, that you are a poser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time this voice will get harder to hear.  The poser thing stays with you for a long time only if you listen to the voice in your head that keeps that connection alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, stop.  Regroup, stop listening to that voice and make a plan.  All of these will help drown out the voice and hopefully you will become deaf to her ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an overweight person my whole life.  Like, for real.  I was a fat kid, a fat teen and a fat adult.  At my largest I was 300 pounds, a size 28 and a 5 x in tops.  I was a big girl, for sure…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are overweight, you probably can feel my pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was worried about all kinds of things—will I be able to fit in that booth at the restaurant, will I be able to get a seat belt extender for the plane, the list goes on….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not only annoying, but downright embarrassing.  I remember going into the store to buy groceries and a little blue-haired lady came up to me and indignantly said, “I don’t think you need these cookies.” She promptly took them out of my basket.  I was beyond embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to crawl in a hole and never come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really plodded through life &lt;u&gt;knowing&lt;/u&gt; that I would never be a “normal-sized” person.  There was no hoping anymore; I lost that a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered a workplace contest.  For money.  Because….I really liked money.  I expected to lose weight and gain it right back; however, the contest was for an extended period of time-6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never done a weight loss challenge for that amount of time.  I was worried about how I was going to do and knew that I needed more than a diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I needed a plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I set my brain afire with a plan on how to lose weight in order to win that money.  Yes, I knew how to get it off fast, but how do I do it so it will stay off for 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to decide how I was going to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What diet to choose was the bane of my existence for many years.  I had a hard time eating anything other than fast food and chocolate.  How the hell was I going to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I picked a plan I felt I could stick to.&lt;/strong&gt;  I started Weight Watchers.  They have an excellent program that gives you some freedom to pick what you want to eat and count your points. I liked that they had guidelines, meetings and educational info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, I knew I also needed something to get me moving—and I am not talking about changing the channel or walking to the refrigerator either.  I had to get serious and get serious fast…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I like to do as far as exercise? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duh-who likes to exercise?  Ewww.  I really had to think long and hard about this.  I had always wanted to be a runner in school, but sucked at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else was pretty intimidating because it had me going into a gym where I wasn’t too sure I could  even fit into the machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought long and hard, and felt this was my best option.  I knew I would have to walk first, and that was a lot less intimidating then gym work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I started to exercise with a local running group.&lt;/strong&gt; The accountability was important to me, because obviously I had issues with it and knew that for the first few months I needed someone to push me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking at first, and let me tell you, (no filter) it was absolutely horrid my first day.  I walked 5 miles and thought I was going to die.  But I didn’t die, and I kept going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I did 1 full marathon and more than 25 half-marathons during my running journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now what?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the next thing I did was to become the town cryer.  I told everyone about this contest.  I am talking &lt;u&gt;everyone.&lt;/u&gt; From my hairdresser, to my family to the guy with the lazy eye at the grocery store-I told them all in detail what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to, believe me, I wanted to keep it secret, because if I failed, there would be no one staring and me thinking I was a big fat loser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are saying to yourself, ok, thats all well and good, but how did you &lt;u&gt;stay&lt;/u&gt; on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you, that was the biggest challenge for me and for anyone that has started a diet plan or an exercise plan-how in the hell do you stay on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest thing I did besides the obvious diet and exercise changes was being ok with failure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are saying to yourself, come on, you have got to be kidding me—be ok with failure?  Umm, I want to be successful, why in the world are you talking about failing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  failure is thing for me. Failing made me the way I was and I didn’t want to be the way I was—at least I didn’t for a 6 month period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I also knew myself well.  I knew that failure was gonna happen.  I mean, come on, its 6 months!  That is a long time to go without cake, if you know what I am saying…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I created the 49/51% rule.&lt;/strong&gt; This rule has absolutely, unequivocally saved my live and was the defining factor in &lt;u&gt;keeping my weight off&lt;/u&gt;. Here is the deal.  I liked that I had accountability in the Weight Watchers group and my running group, but I knew at some point failure would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also knew how I have reacted to failure in the past—I dove head first into a chocolate cake, thats how I reacted.  So, the 49/51 % rule was like a built-in fail-safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, if I knew I was going to fail and expected it and planned for it, then it wouldn’t be as disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, for 4 days out of the week I was super strict on the Weight Watchers plan, and 3 days out of the week, well, not so much.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong—I didn’t eat a whole cake every day on the three days I was “off plan.”  I actually ate pretty close to what I ate in the days I was on; with one caveat—if we were going out or I was craving something, I ate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I craved chips, I had some.  Some days I had half the bag, and some days only a few.  I still constrained myself, but gave myself more leeway on those three days than I did on the 4 days when I was super strict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I hit plateaus.  Yes, I got frustrated and wanted to quit at least once a week.  But I was losing weight at a steady pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t come off as fast as it would have if I was on a fad diet, and in my mind, that was frustrating, but I soldiered on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year and a half, I stepped on the scale, and to my delight I was 138 pounds.  I was over the moon about it.  I will leave the next chapter of my journey to my next blog post….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets recap, shall we?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a “diet plan” you can do and doesn’t leave you in binge mode.  Then, pick an exercise you like and have always wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once those are done, tell everyone, even the guy with the lazy eye at the grocery store.  The last and most important part—realize you will fail and implement a way to mitigate how you feel about failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be totally consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viola, weight loss accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="diet" /><category term="exercise" /><category term="failure" /><category term="How I lost 160 Pounds in a Little Over a Year" /><category term="lose weight" /><category term="plan" /><summary type="html">Yes, folks, it can be done, I am living proof.  You can lose weight over 40.  Hell, you can lose weight at any age.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/aim4strength/image/upload/v1514574375/how-I-lost-160-lbs.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Self Sabotage and American Ninja Warrior</title><link href="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/self-sabotage-american-ninja-warrior/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self Sabotage and American Ninja Warrior" /><published>2017-12-10T06:48:57-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-10T06:48:57-08:00</updated><id>https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/self-sabotage-american-ninja-warrior</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/self-sabotage-american-ninja-warrior/">&lt;p&gt;Holy cow!  Another week down and another week closer to getting that American Ninja Warrior application in….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I am humming with excitement and all consuming terror at the thought of even turning in my application.  It&amp;rsquo;s likely nothing will come of it, but……what if something does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this is almost as big as losing weight.  It feels like a goal that is totally outside my realm of achieve and I am having a hard time even picturing myself doing something so crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the same way that day I gave my money to be in a work place competition to win money.  I was totally panic-stricken.  The second I handed over my mulah, I wanted to eat my face off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self Sabotage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh come on—you guys have all done it.  You proclaim your going to get fit and healthy, and then you see a Popeyes and you just cant help diving face deep into some fried chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have set ourselves up for failure at one time or another.  I have done this all my life and really am an expert at it.  In fact, I can self sabotage without even thinking about it, because I am so fearful about how to get to my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big goals, goals outside of our comfort zone or even little goals that freak you out can have you diving into a pint of  Ben&amp;amp;Jerry’s ice cream-and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be weight related goals, fitness goals or health goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be that you are doing a scary new project at work.  For me, meeting people I don&amp;rsquo;t know makes me sick to my stomach and want to run crying to the nearest Carl’s Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips that help me when I am doing something really scary and want to ruin my own progress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  Remember why you are doing what you are doing.  Write it down, talk to people about it, sing it to the world.  You will hate yourself for opening your big fat mouth, but it will make you disinclined to screw your own self over.  Its kind of a form of punishment as you are publicly shaming yourself if you don&amp;rsquo;t do that scary thing, but hey, it works most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  Make a plan.  This one is very important.  You have to have a plan of attack.  This alleviates some stress and helps you to just “getter done.” Sometimes its just easier to follow a written plan that you or someone else made up to alleviate pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  It&amp;rsquo;s ok to be scared shitless.  Give yourself a break.  Allow yourself to feel that fear, but don&amp;rsquo;t let it take over your whole life so you are paralyzed by it.  A little fear gives you a push in the right direction, being taken over by fear makes you stop in your tracks and basically holds you back from achieving your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  Be self aware.  You may not even know that you are super afraid.  You may be like me and have a tendency to actually live life fearfully and in order to realize that you are being a cry baby, you actually have to look inward and talk to yourself about your fears daily.  Yes, I am the weirdo at the store that is muttering under her breath like I have an imaginary friend—“you can do it, Julie, don&amp;rsquo;t be such a wuss, Julie, stop being a cry baby pee-pee pants, Julie….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been fighting the rising fear ever since I said I was going to tryout for ANW.  I have been thwarting myself through diet by eating too much, I have been a bit paralyzed with fear and not doing what I know it will take in order to get to the next level physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here is where the buck stops.  I am putting my money where my mouth is and writing this to call myself out.  I have written out a plan of things to accomplish so that I can just rely on that and not think too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for all you failures, self saboteurs and “losers” out there—We have each others back.  We can change anything in our lives we want to, even do things that you may think are beyond your reach if we &lt;u&gt;believe.&lt;/u&gt; We can do all this stuff together, and help each other be the best selves we can be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="American ninja warrior" /><category term="fear" /><category term="goals" /><category term="plan" /><category term="self aware" /><category term="self sabotage" /><category term="Self sabotage and American Ninja Warrior" /><summary type="html">Holy cow!  Another week down and another week closer to getting that American Ninja Warrior application in….</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/aim4strength/image/upload/v1514574379/american-ninja-warrior.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How To Mitigate the Holiday 15</title><link href="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/mitigate-holiday-15/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How To Mitigate the Holiday 15" /><published>2017-12-05T08:19:23-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-05T08:19:23-08:00</updated><id>https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/mitigate-holiday-15</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/mitigate-holiday-15/">&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny how media switches from diet advice to “eat all things” during the Holidays?  I find it quite ironic how there is no happy medium between these things; you should be starving yourself with celery during the summertime and then gain at least 15 pounds during the holidays or you aren’t doing it up right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been on that rollercoaster for years, and to be completely transparent, still have a tendency to continue on that wild ride.  The temptations abound and it is really hard to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy hell, everyone and their mother posted stuff on National Cookie Day a couple of days ago, and I couldn’t stop salivating.  Pavlov’s dog has nothing on me….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do during this time of year?  Go out and get a Tofurkey to not eat too much fat and protein during Christmas dinner?  Get sugar free Chocolate for Uncle Bobs stocking because he’s a horrible diabetic_ and_ a chocoholic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips I use that can mitigate the “holiday 15.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a plan.  I know I wont be too popular with this tip, but its my top tip for mitigating the holiday weight gain.  Make a plan.  Write it down.  Stick to it.  If you fall off that plan, forgive yourself and move on—dont make it a slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat like you normally do.  I know.  You want me to tell you to eat all the cake.  I would like that, too, but its not feasible.  When I say eat normally, I mean eat the way you always do with a slight caveat—if you know you are going to a party that has tons of stuff, eat light that day, and at night try_ everything_.  Don’t gorge yourself, though.  Christmas and parties are only isolated days, so pick like 2 days during that week that you will be participating in eating crap.  Adjust your calories or your macros and guestmate.  Don’t weigh the next day, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know that willower is dumb.  &lt;u&gt;What?&lt;/u&gt; I don’t believe in willpower.  I am a strong woman who can do anything I set my mind to, but could never lose weight. It means that I just didn’t know how to make my weight loss happen step by step.  Willpower is a word (at least to me) that means only a select few can have it, and the rest of us don’t have what it takes.  Such BS!   I believe that it is habit that creates success, not willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink a ton.  Not alcohol—I meant water.  Water is totally the bane of my existence, and if I never had to drink it again, I wouldn’t.  I don’t like it.  With that being said, if I get desperate enough in a bad situation, I will drink it because I want to not eat all things cake related.  Well, I do, but I don’t want to feel horrible about myself because I got chocolate wasted the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember what the holidays are about.  Hint-its not &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; about food.  I get that you want to make something special for your family, but it doesn’t have to be crap food. Look online-they have healthy choices for every type of food, and Grandma and Grandpa or Uncle Joe don’t have to know what you’re doing in the kitchen.  Some of that stuff is really good and you can’t taste the difference, and some of it you can.  Experiment.  Laugh about it, have fun doing it.  Get the kids involved in making something different this year.  If you come at it like you are doing it for fun or a challenge, you may have buy in from the fam bam.  If you come at it like, “we are so unhealthy, we are going to make stuff that is healthier and doesn’t taste as good,” you may have a Christmas mutany on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is it.  Its hard to do, don’t get me wrong, but it can be done.  Willpower has nothing to do with it.  Planning, preparing and action has &lt;u&gt;everything&lt;/u&gt; to do with it, though.  Even then, you may find that you are still having a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know that most of America is in the same boat as you are.  The key is, to just get back to it. You may gain a few pounds, but I can guarantee it will be less that what it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember what Christmas is about—family, love and giving, not stuffing your face, gaining a ton of weight and hating yourself for it.  You got this!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="Christmas" /><category term="dieting tips" /><category term="Holiday weight gain" /><category term="how to mitigate holiday weight gain" /><category term="willpower" /><summary type="html">Isn’t it funny how media switches from diet advice to “eat all things” during the Holidays?  I find it quite ironic how there is no happy medium between these things; you should be starving yourself with celery during the summertime and then gain at least 15 pounds during the holidays or you aren’t doing it up right.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/aim4strength/image/upload/v1514574379/keep-call-you-are-a-badass.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Jumping into “American Ninja Warrior”</title><link href="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/jumping-into-anw/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jumping into &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;" /><published>2017-12-01T07:53:44-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-01T07:53:44-08:00</updated><id>https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/jumping-into-anw</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/12/jumping-into-anw/">&lt;p&gt;‘Merica….Ninja Warrior, That Is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, its that time of year where American Ninja Warrior starts to search for the most talented people out there to go to Mt Midoriyama.  Well, search no further.  I am here, friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the thought of going through a whole course and being such a total boss that when Kristine Leahy asks me how I did it, I am going to say, “it was really no biggie, Kristine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If age and gas were the defining factor, I would win hands down, no question about it. Just because I am pushing 50 and have been morbidly obese for 75% of my life doesn’t mean I can’t do tryouts. I mean, man, I got a shelf life here. I could need CPR and a whole lot of shocks if I wait much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have decided to apply, I am kind of freaking out.  Like ‘going into the bathroom and hyperventilating for a few minutes before trying to look all put together’ freaking out.…  How the heck am I even going to accomplish this?  What kinds of workouts will I be doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first order of business is to wrap my head around what I will be asked to do.  Sounds dumb, right?  I mean, duh, you have seen ANW, so you know what is expected of you…..wrong. The jumping spider looks easy, but to do it? Fear of falling freaks me out, and I know that its more in my head than it is I can’t do something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My workouts will consist of pull-ups. Followed by pull-ups.  Spattered with a little jumping pull-ups for a finisher.  What I am trying to say is that I will be doing a ton of pull-ups.  Most of the show the contestants are hanging on to small ledges, doorknobs and ropes.  I will need superb grip strength, insane upper body strength and high intensity training for sure….Oh crap, I am in trouble….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep it fun.  I will have to remind myself of this daily. I like to win.  I like to hang upside down.  I like challenging myself.  Usually, fun is not on the top of my list, because I let all the other things cloud this fundamental rule.  I am the kind of person if you tell me I can’t, I will find a way, especially if its important to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take from different types of sports/genres of fitness.  Rock climbing, Gymnastics, Parkour, Calisthenics—they all have something that can be used on the ANW course.  The common theme is upper body strength and high intensity training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train smarter not harder.  Short bouts of HIIT with monkey bar work, dead hangs, pull ups, balance work and ab work with strength training sprinkled in.  I will be doing 3 upper body days and 2 lower body days.  I will have some HIIT every day that I work out, and it will be used as a superset to every exercise.  This is so that I can get my heart up to snuff and because I am slow at everything I do.  I am going to try to tolerate this workout regime and want to be in the gym no longer than 1.5 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet.  Oh. My. Gosh. This will be hands down the hardest.  I have a coach for bodybuilding and am eating to those goals…..well, I am trying, anyways.  I will have to lose weight so those will possibly need to be changed.  Right now I eat a good deal of protein, and will still keep doing that.  I also eat a good deal of carbs, which I will need for high intensity training.  I guess I will need to reign it in so that I can do my best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thats it.  I would love for you to tell me what YOU think I should do that would make me more prepared for this.  I have done a lot of reading on the subject, but there is so much out there, I just feel overwhelmed.  I picked the very things that I feel like you need on the course.  Some things are just plain scary, jumping being one of them.  I am old, hence the fear of falling and breaking a hip is a totally real fear.  Also, I am trying out an ANW gym in Los Angeles.  I have a call in to them to see if they would be willing to host me and a few friends to try and get acquainted with some basic ANW things on the course—the warped wall being one of them as well as the salmon ladder. I will be doing weekly updates on training and what is working versus what is not working-wish me luck!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="aim4strength fitness" /><category term="American ninja warrior" /><category term="diet" /><category term="jumping" /><category term="jumping spider" /><category term="jumpingintoamericanninjawarrior" /><category term="ninja" /><category term="obese" /><category term="training" /><category term="warrior" /><category term="workout" /><summary type="html">‘Merica….Ninja Warrior, That Is.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/aim4strength/image/upload/v1514574377/american-ninja-warrior-logo.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Women Loathe Themselves</title><link href="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/11/why-women-loathe-themselves/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Women Loathe Themselves" /><published>2017-11-26T19:53:45-08:00</published><updated>2017-11-26T19:53:45-08:00</updated><id>https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/11/why-women-loathe-themselves</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aim4strength.netlify.com/blog/2017/11/why-women-loathe-themselves/">&lt;p&gt;I was asking my husband what subject I should write about for my blog.  His answer took me by surprise.  “Write about why women hate themselves and men don’t.”  “We don’t hate ourselves,” I said, my voice an octave higher.  “See, you even get defensive over it.  You women hate yourselves.  You will never catch a man getting all emotional with a few lines on his face or a beer gut. We just don’t think like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He may be right.  It might be my imagination, but I think that women are targeted more through marketing and the media to look, act and feel a certain way.  I mean, geez, just look at TV ads—most are targeted to us about our hair, face, skin and weight.  Men?  Well, they get cool commercials like Tums.  Its always a guy that ate that pizza and now is paying for it.  Or what about this one—Enzyte—we all know carefree “Bob” who waves at his neighbors and has a catchy tune to his male enhancement advertisement.  Come to think of it, thats my husbands ring tone….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I really had to think about it.  Yes, I guess I am a little defensive about it.  Maybe he is right about women not ever being satisfied with themselves.  I mean, if you get a room full of women together, they usually end up talking about their hair, skin, or body in some way and its usually negative in nature.  If they are menopausal like myself, they are talking about facial hair, the hormone pellet and how many things are going south forever and not just for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How in the world can we change our way of thinking, then,  to become more satisfied with ourselves?  What I propose is radical and over the top.  Serious, life changing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop watching TV.  Yup.  Turn off that boob tube.  If you have to, get it out of the room.  In truth, you are actually being brainwashed.  I know, a little extreme.  But is it?  Marketers know that if you hear an ad the first time, its likely not going to phase you.  The 330th  time you hear it,  though, may compulsively call you to buy their product or service. Everyone is susceptible to that, man or woman.  However, I believe that the bulk of products (well, maybe not Enzyte) are being targeted toward women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delete Instagram and Facebook.  Another crazy, over the top thing to do.  However-I can tell you what I do on instagram.  I look at other girls.  No, not in a sleazy way. I do it to compare myself.  I like this girls butt.  I want to have so-in-so’s legs.  What do they eat in a day?  Why does my life suck compared to theirs?  I really don’t see dudes doing that.  If my husband had all these other good-looking men on his instagram and said “hey, do you think I could look like him if I go to the gym more?”  It would totally creep me out.  I do that to him all the time, though. Now, I am not talking forever.  Just a short time.  Maybe a week, maybe a month.  A break may be needed especially if you take an hour or two out of your day just to see other women doing  duck-lipped selfies and sticking their amazing booties out for all the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think of a negative comment to say to yourself, stop.  Think about how you are bombarded every day with marketing ads that tell you that you aren’t good enough, pretty enough or smart enough.  Just be kind to yourself.  How about you tell yourself something nice?  Something like, “I have a lovely nose.”  Then &lt;u&gt;stop&lt;/u&gt; there.  Don’t say “I have a lovely nose, its way better than Marthas.”  That is a comparison.  Also, its kind of mean.  So stop comparing and stop being mean, especially to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hang with people that care about you, not what you look like or what you have. Yup. For years I hung out with takers, people who made me feel dirty and crappy about myself. They sucked me dry and made me feel like i wasn’t worth much. This happened especially when I was at my top weight of 300 pounds.  I have to say, the fault was mine.  I felt like I was nothing, so I was ok with being treated like I was nothing.  Had I thought higher of myself, then I certainly wouldn’t have wasted my time on people that didn’t have my best interest at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wake up and think of 3 things you are grateful for.  Like, &lt;u&gt;every single day.&lt;/u&gt; Sometimes, it can be hard, especially if you are the “glass half empty” kind of gal.  Its amazing how far this seemingly stupid step can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me sad that I spent a better part of my life trying to please others. I do believe we place too much value on what we see through the media—because we all know Big Boob Barbie who lives in a beach house in Malibu is the happiest person in the world and has an amazing life—until breaking news finds her broke, living the homeless life in LA with a slight meth habit she developed living the good life in Malibu.  So, value YOU.  You are unique.  You are cool, weird, quirky or some other adjective that can be inserted to suit what makes up…well, &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;.  Don&amp;rsquo;t be self-loathing, because the one person that should be in your corner all the time is &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="Enzyte" /><category term="Media" /><category term="Self Loathing" /><category term="Weight loss" /><category term="Women" /><summary type="html">I was asking my husband what subject I should write about for my blog.  His answer took me by surprise.  “Write about why women hate themselves and men don’t.”  “We don’t hate ourselves,” I said, my voice an octave higher.  “See, you even get defensive over it.  You women hate yourselves.  You will never catch a man getting all emotional with a few lines on his face or a beer gut.

I mean, how can you lose that much weight without exercising your face off and eating all organic, whole foods you can get from your own back yard? In fact, when I go places with friends, they offer me cupcakes (OMG I absolutely LOVE cake) and say “well, since your thin now, you can eat that” or my personal favorite, “don’t be so militant, you only live once!”. WRONG!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not saying I don&amp;rsquo;t eat those things every now and then, but it’s pretty rare. I am 6 years out from losing this weight, and I am still a zealot when it comes to tracking my food and logging everything that passes by my lips. Hell, I have nightmares when I think I forgot something in my logging app—yes, obsessive behavior at its finest! Most will scoff and think who wants to be on a diet for the rest of their life or that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a balanced life. Guess what? I don’t! I have big food issues—you don&amp;rsquo;t balloon to 300 pounds for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vice is binge eating. I would love to say binge eating is awful, terrible and that I hate it. Truth be told, I feel absolutely amazing and satisfied when doing it. Afterwards, I feel guilt and shame, but honestly I feel like a million bucks physically. I know I am supposed to feel crappy after eating a whole cake or pizza, but physically I don’t. My body loves chocolate layer cake and feels the happiest when a whole cake is in my belly. Mentally, though, it is a horrible cycle of guilt and shame, then anger at yourself for doing the same thing you promised yourself you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do time and time again. Do not misconstrue what I am saying: it is not ok to binge eat. It comes with a whole host of mental mind games like guilt, shame, anger and inequity. Most of us binge to forget any problems or feelings that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to face. This is no bueno. But let’s call a spade a spade—people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it if it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel good, and lots of people do it, otherwise we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a whole country full of fat people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there hope? Of course there is. I have to say, just because I lost the weight doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I don&amp;rsquo;t still have food issues. Food is my drug and that will never go away. And like a drug addict, I have to face this daily, acknowledging that I have the power to change it and forgive myself when I fall off the wagon. Oh and believe me, I have fallen off the wagon too many times to count. We are not perfect beings and your habits and chemical makeup are still going to be ingrained in you even if it’s to a lesser degree. Cake is still delicious, and I can still eat like a truck driver on steroids. I know I have a huge problem when I go to the cheesecake factory with friends and finish all of their food that they are too full to eat. (food rookies…!) Unlike my friends, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a stop button. I am like a goat who would eat the shirt off its owner if he could get a hold of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do you stop binging? Before losing the weight, every diet plan or every exercise plan I approached with a type A attitude. I was either going to do it, or I wasn’t. If I fell off the wagon, I said screw it, I am going to eat since I already messed up. I had pretty much given diets up by the age of 41, and just accepted the fact that I was going to be a fat with lots of health issues for the rest of my life. However, the weight loss contest we did at work saved me. I was focused on something other than weight. I knew how to get from point A to point B if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t weight loss related. I wanted to win money. Plain and simple. End goal—WIN. I figured after the contest I would gain it all back anyways, so I went into it with that mindset. I ate “around” my food issues. I knew I would binge—duh, no secret since that is what I have always done. So, I implemented my 49/51% rule. I had to eat healthy 51% of the time. Over 50% made me a success, so I knew I would be successful if I hit 51%. I built in binging into my diet—I know, another “no no” in the health and fitness world. Once I knew that I could be 51% successful, the pressure to be perfect dissipated and I actually binged less.  Today, I would have to say I am about 70% successful and 30% binger. I still have issues with perfection and fear of failure, but I do weird stuff for that I will talk about another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in closing, I hope you realize that fear and self-loathing does nothing but keep you stuck in a vicious circle that keeps you stagnant. You CAN lose weight if you are a binger—it absolutely can be done, but you have to change your mindset and your ideas of what success is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;uri&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;github&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html">You probably think that since I have lost 160+ pounds that I have the food thing figured out, right?
